### Abstract

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective formulation for the Menu Planning Problem (MPP), which we have termed the Multi-objective Menu Planning Problem (MMPP). Menu planning is of great interest in the health field due to the importance of proper nutrition in today's society, and particularly in school cafeterias. Most of the related literature on menu planning deals with single-objective formulations of the problem, mainly focused on minimising the menu cost while satisfying a set of constraints. In this paper, in addition to considering cost as an objective, we also introduce a second objective function aimed at minimising the degree of repetition of the meals that shape the final plan. Generally speaking, people need non-repetitive meals, not only for health reasons, but also in order to avoid detesting certain meals. As a result, the motivation behind our novel formulation is to offer meal planning that is not only affordable, but also varied and balanced from a nutritional standpoint. The planning is designed for a given number of days and ensures that the particular nutritional requirements of children are satisfied. Furthermore, other special circumstances such as allergies, food intolerances, and specific constraints regarding religion or lifestyle habits, for instance, may be considered as well. However, since the aforementioned features are more focused on a particular person rather than on a group of people, their study is beyond the scope of this work. The computational results obtained by a set of well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithms show that suitable menu plans, in terms of nutritional values, are achieved. In addition, the multi-objective nature of our novel formulation is also demonstrated. The cheapest menu plans are those with the lowest variety of meals, while the largest variety of meals is given by the most expensive plans. Finally, we should note that the novel formulation may be adapted, with little effort, to deal with the specific nutritional requirements of other groups of people, such as patients in hospitals and convicts in prisons, among others.
